            Preheat the oven to 350Â°. In a large enameled cast-iron casserole,
            melt the butter in 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Arrange the meat
            in the casserole in a single layer and season with salt and pepper.
            Cook over moderately high heat, turning occasionally, until browned
            on all sides, 8 minutes. Add the chopped onion and garlic and cook
            over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is
            softened, 5 minutes. Add the flour and stir to coat the meat with
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add the wine, bay leaves and thyme, season with salt and pepper
            and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve any brown bits stuck to
            the bottom of the pot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover the casserole and transfer it to the oven. Cook the stew for
            1 1/2 hours, until the meat is very tender and the sauce is flavorful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in a saucepan, cover the pancetta with 2 cups of water
            and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
            Drain the pancetta and slice it 1/2 inch thick, then cut the slices
            into 1-inch-wide lardons.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a large skillet, combine the pancetta, pearl onions, mushrooms
            and carrots. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4 cup
            of water and a large pinch each of sugar, salt and pepper. Bring to
            a boil, cover and simmer until almost all of the water has
            evaporated, 15 minutes. Uncover and cook over high heat, tossing,
            until the vegetables are tender and nicely browned, about 4 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To serve, stir some of the vegetables and lardons into the stew and
            scatter the rest on top as a garnish. Top with a little chopped
            parsley and serve.
