            In a large saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the
            pancetta and cook over moderate heat until the fat has been
            rendered, about 5 minutes. Add the onion and cook, stirring
            occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the beans, thyme
            sprigs, water and stock and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat,
            stirring and skimming occasionally, until the beans are al dente,
            about 1 hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add the garlic cloves to the beans and simmer until the garlic and
            beans are tender, about 15 minutes. Discard the thyme sprigs.
            Season the beans with salt and let cool to room temperature. Cover
            and refrigerate the saucepan overnight.

          </p>
          <p>
            Preheat the oven to 350Â°. Rewarm the beans over moderate heat.
            Transfer the beans to a large, deep baking dish. Nestle the duck
            legs, garlic sausage and bacon into the beans. Bake for about 40
            minutes, until the cassoulet is bubbling and all of the meats are
            hot. Remove from the oven and let rest for 15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the
            bread crumbs and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until
            browned and crisp, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the bread crumbs and
            the parsley over the cassoulet and serve.
