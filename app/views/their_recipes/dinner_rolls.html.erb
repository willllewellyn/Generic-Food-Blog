                Warm, crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside, homemade
                dinner rolls sound good to you? (Who doesn't want to gorge 
                themselves on bread?)

          <p>
            Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl and set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Place 1/4 cup of the water in a 1-cup glass measure. Add the yeast
            and stir until dissolved. Stir in the sugar and allow to stand for
            about 10 to 15 minutes or until the bubbly froth reaches the 1/2
            cup mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make a well in the flour and pour in the proofed yeast mixture.
            Add the milk and another 1/4 cup of the water and begin mixing.
            Continue to add the final 1/4 cup of water in 1 tablespoon
            increments until your dough is fairly moist and soft.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knead for about 8 to 10 minutes, either by hand or using the dough
            hook on a stand mixer, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place
            it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp towel and allow to
            rise at room temperature for about 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and punch down.
            Cover again and let it rest for about 5 minutes, then divide it into
            12 pieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gently roll each piece into an oval shape. Place them on 2 lightly
            greased baking sheets about two inches apart. Cover them with a
            damp towel and allow them to rise for about 30 minutes. Using the
            thin side of a spatula handle, make a deep impression in the center
            of each roll. Cover again and let rest for another 15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the rolls are resting, place an oven-proof dish with about
            1-1/2-inches of water in it in the lower third of your oven and
            preheat to 450Â°F.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bake the rolls for 15 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on a wire
            rack for about 5 minutes and serve warm.
