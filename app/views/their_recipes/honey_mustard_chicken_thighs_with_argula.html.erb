            Prepare Honey Mustard Sauce: Whisk together the honey, mustard,
            mayonnaise, and chicken stock. Set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prepare Ingredients: Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pat the chicken thighs
            dry and season with salt and pepper. Mince the shallot. Rub any dirt
            off the mushrooms. Remove the stems and set aside. In a food
            processor, combine the stems and five mushroom caps and pulse until
            finely minced. Slice the remaining caps. Finely chop the parsley.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cook the Chicken: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high.
            Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook for 5-7 minutes without
            moving until the skin is crisp and the fat has rendered. Cook the
            chicken in batches if necessary to avoid over-crowding the pan. Once
            the chicken skin has browned, transfer the chicken thighs, skin-side
            up, to a large baking or casserole dish. Set aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now it’s time to prepare the sauce! Prepare the Honey Mustard Sauce:
            Drain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet. Add 1
            tablespoon of oil to the skillet and return the skillet to medium
            high heat. Add the shallot and the minced mushroom stems and cook
            until softened and beginning to brown. Turn the heat to high and
            continue cooking for another minute or two. Add the honey mustard
            sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cook for 5-10 minutes
            until reduced slightly and thickened. Pour the sauce over the
            chicken and transfer the baking dish to the oven for about 20
            minutes or until the chicken registers 165ºF with an instant read
            thermometer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prepare the Mushrooms and Arugula: During the last 10 minutes of the
            chicken baking, prepare the arugula and mushrooms. Wipe out the
            skillet used to cook the honey mustard sauce and add the remaining
            tablespoon of oil. Turn the heat to medium high and once shimmering
            and very hot, add the sliced mushroom caps and season with salt and
            pepper. Cook for 8-12 minutes, stirring often, until well-browned.
            Add the sherry and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of
            the skillet. Once the sherry has been absorbed by the mushrooms
            (About 2 minutes of cooking), add the arugula and all but a pinch or
            two of the chopped parsley and season with salt and pepper. Cook for
            about 2-3 minutes or until the arugula has just wilted. Remove from
            heat and keep warm.
          </p>
          <p>
            To Serve: Divide the arugula and mushrooms between shallow bowls.
            Place a chicken thigh on top and ladle the honey mustard sauce over
            the dish. Serve with a sprinkle of the remaining chopped parsley on
            each dish. Enjoy!
