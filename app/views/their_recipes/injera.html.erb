          <p>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours and salt until well mixed
          </p>
          <p>
            Add the water, stirring until combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover loosely with a paper towel and let stand, undisturbed overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gently agitate the mixture with a wooden spoon in the morning
            (there should be bubbles already forming on the surface, and the
            fermenting water should have risen to the top).
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover again and let stand at room temperature, undisturbed overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repeat this cycle once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 3 to 4 days, your injera should smell sour and be very
            bubbly, which means that it's ready! Stir the mixture until combined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heat a large, lightly-oiled heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high
            heat. Add about 1/3 cup of the batter to the skillet, forming a thin
            layer of batter over the pan. Cook until bubbles form on the entire
            surface of the flatbread (do not flip; only cook one side like a crepe).
          </p>
          <p>
            Using a metal spatula, remove the injera and transfer to a plate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repeat until all of the batter is used, adding oil to the skillet
            as necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Serve with spicy vegetables, lentils, or meat dishes of your choice.
