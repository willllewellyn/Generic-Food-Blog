            In a medium saucepan, combine the balsamic vinegar with the onion
            and 2 thyme sprigs and boil over moderately high heat until reduced
            to 1/3 cup, about 10 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a heatproof
            cup. Add the stock to the saucepan and boil over moderately high
            heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 10 minutes. Add the balsamic
            reduction and boil until the liquid is thickened and reduced to 2/3
            cup, about 15 minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Strain the balsamic sauce. Transfer 1/4 cup of the sauce to a small
            bowl and reserve. Return the rest to the saucepan and stir in the
            molasses, mustard and crushed red pepper; let the glaze cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            Place the pork roasts on a large rimmed baking sheet and season
            generously with salt. Coat the roasts with the glaze and let stand
            for 30 minutes, brushing occasionally (the glaze will slide off
            the meat).
          </p>
          <p>
            Preheat the oven to 300°. Set a rack in a large roasting pan.
            Transfer the roasts to the rack, allowing the glaze to drip back
            onto the sheet. Top the roasts with the remaining 4 sprigs of thyme
            and the garlic and rosemary; season with salt. Add 1/2 inch of
            water to the roasting pan and roast the pork for about 2 1/2 hours,
            until it is richly glazed and an instant-read thermometer inserted
            in the thickest part of the roasts registers 145°. Add water to the
            pan as it dries out and baste the meat with the pan juices from time
            to time during roasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transfer the roasts to a cutting board and cover loosely with foil.
            Let rest for 20 minutes. Carve the roasts into chops and arrange on
            a platter. Drizzle with the reserved balsamic sauce and serve.
